        <p class="caption">“Green Screen” is a variable print edition that Alexis Nutini produced in 2020. These prints combine several woodblocks that were carved traditionally by hand and blocks that were made using a CNC router. The color was selected methodically in order to create variation while maintaining a cohesive feel to the series. These are 4 out of 6 samples from the variable edition.

        <p>Dos Tres Press is a print studio in South Philadelphia specializing in rigorous experimentation with relief printmaking techniques —a form of printmaking in which the image to be printed is raised from the surface. Alexis Nutini, the founder and master printer, focuses on one-of-a-kind impressions and developing collaborative print-based projects with international and local artists as well as socially engaged Philadelphia organizations.</p>

        <p>These relationships and collaborations are nurtured through Mr. Nutini’s use of  hand-carved, reduction woodblock printing, and platemaking through Computer Numerical Control (CNC) routing techniques as part of the project development process. Technology has enabled him to cut back on the labor intensive process of making wood blocks, and has freed him to focus on working on the concepts and ideas.</p>

        <p>Committed to the advancement of the printmaking medium, Mr. Nutini invites the local community to actively participate and learn through workshops, demonstrations and the mentorship of aspiring printmakers.</p>

        <p> Making woodcuts from start to finish is a methodical process that requires excellent organizational skill and a space designed for efficiency and a perfectly choreographed workflow. Once you are in the studio you can tell how much thought went into mapping each of the studios areas to maximize the printmaking.</p>

                <h3>BLOCKS (Stamps)</h3>
                <p>The printmaking process begins by carving blocks or stamps out of sheets of plywood. Mr. Nutini uses a CNC router to create these blocks efficiently ahead of time and has developed a library of blocks that he uses throughout his print projects. </p>

                <h3>INKING</h3>
                <p>Once the blocks are selected to be included into a composition, they are moved to the inking area. Here they get an even layer of an oil based ink applied with a roller or brayer. The colors are carefully selected ahead of time and layered in a way that will make sense in the final composition. </p>

            <div class="inner">
                <h3>PRESS</h3>
                <p>After the block gets inked they are placed on the bed of the relief press. These presses have been in use for centuries, and the technology has not changed very much over the decades. Master printers have used these presses to print etchings, woodcuts, colographs, and other types of prints.</p>
                <p>At the press, a sheet of paper gets placed on top of the plate and is run under a cylinder that applies even pressure as the plate passes through the press. This process gets repeated each time a new color is applied. Sometimes prints have over 10 to 15 layers of color once they are completed. </p>

                <h3>DRYING</h3>
                <p>The prints get placed in the drying rack after they have been run through the press. Depending on the density of the color it takes several days for the ink to dry because the ink used in the process is oil based and it takes several days for the binder in the ink to oxidize. This is where they completely dry at the end of the printing process. </p>

This space is very important because it allows the master printer to review and compare different variations of the prints to control for quality and consistency.</p>

At this stage the total number of prints in the edition is determined. The prints are individually numbered, titled, and signed by the artist.</p>
